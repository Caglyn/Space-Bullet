# Space Bullet (Stratera Games Internship 2022 Project) <br>

I made the game based on the game design document shared from Stratera Games. https://github.com/strateragames/internship2022 <br>

* I designed the ships from https://kenney.itch.io/ship-mixer, took SFX from https://freesfx.co.uk/, took interface icons, vectors from https://svgrepo.com and https://www.kenney.nl/assets.

* There are some small changes in the gameplay part for example I made the project for pc so because there is no tapping on pc, player should use Space key to shoot instead of tapping.

* There are no animations in the game. I made the project in about 10 days and I want to move on. So I didn't really focus on animations.

Here are some screenshots from the game: <br>
